These bins should be compatible with Harbor Freight cases.

My design is meant to be compatible, but also easy to print and use minimal filament. To meet these goals:
    - the bins don't have tiny feet on the bottom
    - the bins have a rim around the top which adds strength and rigity while allowing the walls to be thinner than they would otherwise need to be.

The lack of feet should not be a problem because Stanley/HF carry cases use both depressions for the feet and tabs on the top of the case that hold the top of the bins.

Harbor Freight cases and bins are a cheap knock-off of Stanley organizers. HF uses the same grid size, but much thinner plastic for the bins and cases. Even though they look compatible, the Stanley and HF bins have different heights.
