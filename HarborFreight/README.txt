This is part of the Compatible Bins project which you can find at https://github.com/julie777/Compatible-Bins

The GitHub project contains:
- variants for other systems, 
- full documention of the design, 
- and the Fusion 360 model along with instructions on customization

These bins are design to be compatible with Harbor Freight cases. 
    https://www.harborfreight.com/20-bin-medium-portable-parts-storage-case-93928.html

The design is meant to be compatible, but also easy to print and use minimal filament. To meet these goals:
    - the bins don't have tiny feet on the bottom, which should not be a problem because Stanley/HF carry cases use both depressions for the feet and tabs on the top of the case that hold the top of the bins.
    - the bins have a rim around the top which adds strength and rigity while allowing the walls to be thinner than they would otherwise need to be.
    - the model thickness dimensions are based on the extruder being set to a width of .45 using a .4mm nozzle.



Models are distributed as 3MF files and have all the settings for the best printing with Prusa MK3S+ included.
If you have a Prusa MK3S+ you can just print from the gcode files included.

Standard HF bin sizes are 1x1, 2x1, 2x2. Some custom sizes are included. If you want other sizes create an issue on GitHub.


Note:
Harbor Freight cases and bins are a cheap knock-off of Stanley organizers. HF uses the same grid size, but much thinner plastic for the bins and cases. Even though they look compatible, the Stanley and HF bins have different heights.
