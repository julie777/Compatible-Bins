# Compatible-Bins
3D printable models for organizer bins that are compatible with commercial systems

# Project Goal

Provide 3D printable models for bins (insert boxes) that are compatible with various storage/organizer systems on the market. This allow printing replacements for lost or damaged bins and the ability to printer different sized bins to optimize storage. (For example: replacing a large bin with multiple smaller ones.)

# Supported Systems

The following systems are supported and have models available to download.
- Harbor Freight
- Stanley
- Sortimo/Bosch L-Boxx, I-Boxx, T-Boxx
- Tanos/Festool
- Raaco

If there are other systems you would like added please create an issue [providing dimensions] and a reference link.

Note: the bins are not identical to the ones that ship with the commercial systems. They are designed to be compatible, but easy to print and to use as little filament as possible (cheap).

# Customization

The Fusion 360 Model is provided to allow customization, creating odd sized bins, or any other purpose. The design of the bins, information needed to use the parameters, and printing information is available on the Wiki.
