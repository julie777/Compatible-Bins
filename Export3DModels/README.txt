This is a Fusion 360 script used to generate all the combinations of system/size models.

The intent is to generate the 3mf files from the Fusion model, add in the configuration for Prusa Slicer and use the slicer to generate the gcode. This will provide all the files ready to upload to thangs.com or other sites.

It is still a work in progress.
